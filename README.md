# Mini-Briscola

## Overview

**Briscola** is a Python implementation of the classic Italian card game, brought to life with a retro-style graphical interface using the [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) game engine.

## Modules Used

This game uses the following Python libraries:

- **Pyxel**: For rendering graphics and managing game mechanics.
- **enum**: For managing card suits and ranks (part of Python's standard library).
- **random**: For shuffling the deck and creating randomized gameplay (also part of Python's standard library).
